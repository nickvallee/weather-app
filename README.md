##Nick's Weather App

This is the weather app I built for a FreeCodeCamp project. It uses the Darksky.net API to get weather data, and set's the information based on geolocation. I will be incrementally improving it's functionality as I gain more knowledge, and will be changing the CSS to make it prettier very soon!

##How to Run

Just [follow this link](https://nickvallee.github.io/weather-app/) and allow location services when the broswer prompts you to do so.
